    --Functions
    do
        ---Returns the current "life" of a unit. Also referred to as "hit points". All units in DCS have a value that defines how much life is left. If this value is less than 1 the unit is considered "dead". Ground and ship units that are on fire and in the process of "cooking off" will return a life value of 0 until the object explodes. Aircraft are more complex due to sub-systems and damage models which will effect the life value.
        ---https://wiki.hoggitworld.com/view/DCS_func_getLife
        ---@return number
        function SceneryObject.getLife(self) end

        ---Return a description table of the given object. Table entries are dependent on the category of object and the sub-categories that may exist within that object type. Function also works with Unit, Weapon, Static Object, Scenery Object, Airbase.
        ---https://wiki.hoggitworld.com/view/DCS_func_getDesc
        ---@return SceneryObject_desc
        function SceneryObject.getDesc(self) end

        ---Return a description table of the specified Object type. Object does not need to be in the mission in order to query its data. Function works with Unit, Static Object, Scenery Object, Airbase.
        ---https://wiki.hoggitworld.com/view/DCS_func_getDescByName
        ---@return SceneryObject_desc
        ---@param typeName string
        function SceneryObject.getDescByName(typeName) end

        --Inhereted fuctions from Object class
        do
            do
                ---Return an enumerator of the category for the specific object. The enumerator returned is dependent on the category of the object. See enumerators Group.Category, SceneryObject.Category, and Spot.Category for further reference. Function also works with Unit, Weapon, Static Object, Scenery Object, Airbase. When used with any of these objects the category returned is related to the SceneryObject.Category.
                ---https://wiki.hoggitworld.com/view/DCS_func_getCategory
                ---@return Object.Category
