        ---Creates an infrared ray emanating from the given object to a point in 3d space. Can be seen with night vision goggles. localRef is technically an optional variable, however the functions format requires an entry to be made. If not used, simply replace with nil.

        ---Creates a laser ray emanating from the given object to a point in 3d space. localRef is technically an optional variable, however the functions format requires an entry to be made. If not used, simply replace with nil If optional variable laserCode is not present the beam will automatically be set to a IR beam. If laserCode is specified the beam is a laser which can be used to guide laser guided bombs.Laser code is any 4 digit number between 1111 and 1788.

        ---Destroys the object, physically removing it from the game world without creating an event. The object simply disappears. If used with a group, the entire group will be destroyed. Function also works with Unit, Weapon, Static Object, Scenery Object, Airbase

        ---Return an enumerator of the category for the specific object. The enumerator returned is dependent on the category of the object. See enumerators Group.Category, Object.Category, and Spot.Category for further reference. Function also works with Unit, Weapon, Static Object, Scenery Object, Airbase. When used with any of these objects the category returned is related to the Object.Category.

        ---Returns a vec3 table of the x, y, and z coordinates for the position of the given object in 3D space. Coordinates are dependent on the position of the maps origin. In the case of the Caucuses theater, the origin is located in the Crimean region of the map. Function also works with Unit, Weapon, Static Object, Scenery Object, Airbase.
