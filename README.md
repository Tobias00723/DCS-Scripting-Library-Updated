# DCS-Scripting-Library

Provides a baseline Scripting Library for DCS for use in VS Code. This incudes Intellisense and auto code completion. You have the option to add other Environment by simply drag and droping the `.lua` file into the directory. What's unique about it is that you don't have to have other windows open or be imbeded in a project to access the features it provides.
